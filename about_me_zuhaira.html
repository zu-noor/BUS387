                <p>As an international student and mentor, I've witnessed how genuine human connections can transcend cultural and linguistic barriers. This experience has reinforced my belief that empathy and open communication are essential for creating inclusive spaces where everyone can thrive.</p>
                
                <p>I approach both my technical work and community involvement with a commitment to accessibility and understanding. My goal is to use my computer science skills alongside my interpersonal abilities to create technology and communities that bring people together rather than divide them.</p>
